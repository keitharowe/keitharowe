## Strategic Technology Direction, Roadmap, Application Modernization - Perfect Game

Apr 2023 - Aug 2024

Perfect Game USA is an organization dedicated to the development and promotion of youth baseball.
They host travel team tournaments and individual showcases, to promote and provide valuable
exposure for young athletes and to gain exposure to college coaches and MLB scouts.

Prior to Bennett Adelson’s involvement, Perfect Game lacked effective internal software development,
delivery, poor code quality, little to no QA and no Agile processes or ceremonies. The team often faced
urgent issues without the necessary system processes or guidance.

To address these concerns the engagement was divided into three phases:

- Phase I: Migration from Rackspace to Azure for all business-critical applications and databases
- Phase II: Software Development Practices and Procedures, Agile transformation, and Continuous
  Integration and Continuous Deployment
- Phase III: Defining the Future State, Software Architecture

### Phase I - Azure App Services and Azure SQL Managed Instance

The infrastructure footprint at Rackspace was comprised of several large dedicated virtual machines that
were expensive to maintain, were running outdated operating systems and applications, and were not
configured for reliability and scalability. As such, business applications were migrated to Azure app
services and core database services were migrated to Azure SQL Managed Instance.

### Phase II - Leadership, Agile Ceremonies, and Azure DevOps Pipelines and git

Workflows

Software development processes for the entire 10-person development team had numerous bad
practices. For example, the team was deploying code to production directly from their workstations.
Code was not routinely merged into a main branch for other developers.

### Phase III Defining the Future State and Software Architecture

Perfect Game USA over the years has put an enormous effort into the software that runs their business without a long-term vision. Bennett Adelson worked with Perfect Game to define the future tech stack and direction.

## Application Modernization – FirstEnergy, Pennsylvania Customer Assistance Program - PCAP

Feb 2022 - Apr 2023

FirstEnergy is a Fortune 500 utility company operating in the Northeast region of the United States. The Pennsylvania Customer Assistance Program (PCAP) is designed to help income qualified residential customers maintain electric service and eliminate their past due balance. The legacy application was written in the late 90s and due to its age was only used internally by FirstEnergy employees. The public facing online enrollment was handled and managed by an external third-party Dollar Energy Fund. FirstEnergy was looking to bring the application in-house to provide updated application security, increased systems integrations with backend systems, and greater visibility into customer issues and eliminate duplicated processes and data entry.

Since the legacy application was written approximately two decades ago, and since the system workflow, data processing and customer service were largely handled by an external third party uncovering or discovering the core business logic was extremely difficult. An extended period was dedicated to requirements with activities such as Event Storming and in-depth team interviews were conducted, striking a balance between agile and waterfall for discovery.

Once the system boundaries were understood, the team adopted Domain-Driven Design as a software paradigm. Team members consisted of both Bennett Adelson members, a senior developer, UI/UX designer, and cloud architect as well as members of FirstEnergy developer staff and a project manager. The application had a very complex, time sensitive workflow process and data management requirements.

Following this principle, this allowed the team to move in a very agile fashion with a
focus on just-in-time requirement gathering. Additionally, the budget and scope allowed for frequent refactoring. Having the latitude to rework core sections as the team learned more about the system and how it should behave was crucial for the success of the project.
